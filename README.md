# Portolio-T3: The Dev Portfolio Builder powered by the T3 Stack
Forkable, hightly customizable **Dev Portfolio Builder** with an assortment of components specifically designed for Devs in mind. It's powered by the  **[T3 Stack](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app)** and can be deployed anywhere but it was designed in mind to run on **[Vercel](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app)**


## One Caveat: To install you need to run:
```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
# this resolves the lottie-react dependency issue
```



## I want more things!
Feel free to fork the project and create new Components, Layouts, Integrations or Features. If you would love to contribute please create a ticket to let me know what you're working on and a pull request. Thanks!
